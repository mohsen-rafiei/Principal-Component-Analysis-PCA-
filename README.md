# PCA Analysis Project

This project demonstrates how to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to explore and reduce the dimensionality of a dataset. The dataset contains five continuous variables, and the analysis focuses on identifying patterns and reducing complexity while retaining variance.

## Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a widely-used technique in data science and statistics for dimensionality reduction. It transforms correlated variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated components, making data visualization and interpretation easier.

## Files Included

1. **`pca_data.csv`**  
   - A dataset with 100 samples and 5 continuous variables, simulated to demonstrate PCA.  

2. **`pca_analysis.Rmd`**  
   - An R Markdown file that includes:
     - Data exploration and standardization.
     - PCA computation using the `prcomp` function.
     - Visualization of results with a scree plot and a biplot.

## Steps to Run the Analysis

1. **Download the Files**:  
   Clone this repository or download the files manually.

2. **Install Required Packages**:  
   Ensure the following R packages are installed:
   ```R
   install.packages("tidyverse")
   ```

3. **Open and Run the R Markdown File**:  
   Open `pca_analysis.Rmd` in RStudio. Follow the steps to:
   - Explore the dataset.
   - Perform PCA.
   - Visualize the results using scree plots and biplots.

## Why Use PCA?

PCA helps simplify datasets by identifying key components that explain the most variance. This is useful when:
- Visualizing high-dimensional data.
- Reducing noise or redundancy in features.
- Preparing data for further analysis or modeling.
